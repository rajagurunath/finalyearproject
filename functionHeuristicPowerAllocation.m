function powerallocation = functionHeuristicPowerAllocation(rhos,q,weights)
%Calculates the power allocation in Theorem 3.16 assuming fixed beamforming
%directions, weighted sum rate maximization, and a total power constraint
%per base station. This allocation is optimal for coordinated beamforming
%with zero-forcing transmission. Otherwise, the allocation is heuristic/suboptimal.

%INPUT:
%rhos    = Kt x Kr matrix with effective channel gains. Element (j,k) is
%          |h_{jk}^H C_{jk} D_{jk} \bar{v}_{jk}|^2/sigma_k^2, where
%          \bar{v}_{jk} is the beamforming direction. Note that this
%          rhos(j,k)>0 only for base stations j that serve user k.
%q       = Kt x 1 vector with total power at j:th base station
%weights = Kr x 1 vector with positive weights for each user
%
%OUTPUT:
%powerallocation = Kt x Kr matrix with power allocation coefficients.
