%Solves the fairness-profile optimization (FPO) problem in Example 2.8 in
%the book:
%
%Emil Björnson, Eduard Jorswieck, “Optimal Resource Allocation in
%Coordinated Multi-Cell Systems,” Foundations and Trends in Communications
%and Information Theory, vol. 9, no. 2-3, pp. 113-381, 2013.
%
%This is a generalization of max-min fairness optimization. The FPO
%problem searches on a line between LOWERPOINT and UPPERPOINT and finds
%the intersection between the line and the Pareto boundary of the rate
%region. The search is based on bisection and solving a power minimization
%under QoS requirements; for example, as in (2.30).
%
%The FPO problem is equivalent to finding (g_1,...,) that solves
%
%maximize min_k ( g_k - lowerPoint(k) ) / ( upperPoint(k) - lowerPoint(k) )
%
%subject to     g_k >= lowerPoint(k) for all users k,
%               Power constraints.
%
%This problem is quasi-convex, meaning that it can be solved as a short
%sequence of convex optimization problem. The computational complexity is
%therefore polynomial in the number of users, antennas, and power
%constraints. The implementation can, at least, handle 30 users, 50
%antennas, and 50 power constraints.

%
%INPUT:
%H           = Kr x Kt*Nt matrix with row index for receiver and column
%              index transmit antennas
%D           = Kt*Nt x Kt*Nt x Kr diagonal matrix. Element (j,j,k) is one if
%              j:th transmit antenna can transmit to user k and zero otherwise
%Qsqrt       = N x N x L matrix with matrix-square roots of the L weighting
%              matrices for the L power constraints
%q           = Limits of the L power constraints
%delta       = Accuracy of the final solution. The algorithm terminates when
%                 norm(upperPoint - lowerPoint) <= delta
%lowerPoint  = Start point of the line (must be inside the rate region)
%upperPoint  = End point of the line (must be outside of the rate region)
%specialMode = (Optional) Consider different non-idealities in the system
%              model. Normally we have specialMode==0. 
%              Transceiver impairments is given by specialMode==1.
%specialParam = (Optional) Additional parameters for each specialMode.
%               specialMode==1: 2 x 1 vector with EVM at the transmit and 
%               receive antennas, respectively. These are used along with
%               linear distortion functions.

%OUTPUT:
