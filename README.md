This Repository contains matlab code for diiferent techniques of Spectrum Sensing and their Simulations

An Artificial intelligence based decision making techniques are proposed to make the decision  in the fusion centre
in the centralized spectrum sensing technique (in soft combining technique) .In our work we analysed three techniques 
of Artifical intelligence  such as ANN(Artificial neural network),Fuzzy-logic ,Fuzzy neural network(FNN) to make 
decision about Occupancy of  the channel(channel status) . Among those FNN gives an efficient decision about the spectrum vacancy.
These neural networks are trained based on parameters  such as Energy detection,matched filter,distance between PU and SU,
SNR,Spectral efficiency.

In this paper, we replaced an efficient spectrum sensing scheme called spatial false alarm with combination of 
GLRT with our proposed work to increase the robustness, resilency and reduce sensing interval. Cooperative spectrum sensing 
technique is used  to reduce noise uncertainty and hidden node problem  and to  achieve high performance in the 
probability of false alarm(PFA) and probability of detection(PD) for secondary user(SU).
