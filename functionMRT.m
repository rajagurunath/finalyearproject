function wMRT = functionMRT(H,D)
%Calculates the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming vectors for a
%scenario where all or a subset of antennas transmit to each user.

%INPUT:
%H  = Kr x Kt*Nt matrix with row index for users and column index
%     transmit antennas
%D  = Kt*Nt x Kt*Nt x Kr diagonal matrix. Element (j,j,k) is one if j:th
%     transmit antenna can transmit to user k and zero otherwise
%
%OUTPUT:
%wMRT = Kt*Nt x Kr matrix with normalized MRT beamforming



%Number of users
Kr = size(H,1);

%Total number of antennas
N = size(H,2);

%If D matrix is not provided, all antennas can transmit to everyone
if nargin<2
    D = repmat( eye(N), [1 1 Kr]);
end

%Pre-allocation of MRT beamforming
wMRT = zeros(size(H'));

%Computation of MRT, based on Definition 3.2
for k = 1:Kr
    channelvector = (H(k,:)*D(:,:,k))'; %Useful channel
    wMRT(:,k) = channelvector/norm(channelvector); %Normalization of useful channel
